# Curriculum Vitae

This is the repository for my Curriculum Vitae, which is based on a [XeTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/professional-cv/wvqwpvrmrvkh) by [Alessandro Plasmati](https://plas.contact/).

Additionally, the `publications.bib` file contains bibliographic records of my publications for use with BibTeX.
