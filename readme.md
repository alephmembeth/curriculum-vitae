# Curriculum Vitae

This is the repository for my Curriculum Vitae, which is based on a [XeTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/professional-cv/wvqwpvrmrvkh) by Alessandro Plasmati.

Additionally, the `publications.bib` file contains bibliographic records for my publications for use with BibTeX.
